            <h1 id="finsm.io">finsm.io</h1>
<p>A lightweight app made with Elm and the GraphicsSVG library to build, simulate and export finite state machines. Successfully used in McMaster’s second year Finite Automata course by students to submit assignments. <a href="finsm.io">finsm.io</a> was developed as an open-source project in conjunction with another McMaster student.</p>
<h1 id="newyouthapp">NewYouthApp</h1>
<p>Developed with McMaster Outreach/McMaster Start Coding students, this app was built from the ground up, beginning from the web framework, <a href="https://github.com/CSchank/petri-app-land">Petri-App-Land</a>. Using Elm and Haskell, we worked with Brampton Multicultural Centre to provide an application for new youths to provide resources and help for integrating into Canada.</p>
<h1 id="calccheckweb">CalcCheckWeb</h1>
<p>A theorem prover developed by Dr. Wolfram Kahl, used by second-year students in the Discrete Mathematics course. I contributed some front-end improvements and suggestions for the web interface.</p>
