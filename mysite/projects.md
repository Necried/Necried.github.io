# finsm.io
A lightweight app made with Elm and the GraphicsSVG library to build, simulate and export finite
state machines. Successfully used in McMaster's second year Finite Automata course by students to submit assignments.
[finsm.io](finsm.io) was developed as an open-source project in
conjunction with another McMaster student.


# NewYouthApp
Developed with McMaster Outreach/McMaster Start Coding students, this app was built from the
ground up, beginning from the web framework, [Petri-App-Land](https://github.com/CSchank/petri-app-land).
Using Elm and Haskell, we worked with Brampton Multicultural Centre to provide an application for
new youths to provide resources and help for integrating into Canada.


# CalcCheckWeb
A theorem prover developed by Dr. Wolfram Kahl, used by second-year students in the Discrete Mathematics
course. I contributed some front-end improvements and suggestions for the web interface.
